# PowerShellFun
Collection of PowerShell scripts I wrote for an internship (written independently while learning PowerShell)

These were written to assist me in daily reports/tasks I had to execute in Excel/Access as part of an internship.
They were especially tedious, so I sat out to learn about scripting in MS products and discovered PowerShell.
To be honest, it looked extremely weird at first, but after A LOT of Internset guides / StackOverFlow examples,
I think I got the basic hang of it...
